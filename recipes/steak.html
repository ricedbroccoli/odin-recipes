    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Ingredients</li>
        <li>Your Favorite Cut of Steak, mine is a 12oz Sirloin</li>
        <li>1/2 Stick of Butter</li>
        <li>1 Twig of thyme</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subtitle">Steps</p>

    <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Raise a skillet to medium heat</li>
            <li>Add in the 1/2 Stick of Butter</li>
            <li>Wait for Butter to Melt, and Evenly Coat the Skillet</li>
            <li>While the Skillet is heating up, Go Ahead and put Salt and Pepper to Taste on the Steak</li>
            <li>As soon as the butter is bubbling, put the Steak Offset from the Middle of the Skillet Towards You</li>
            <li>In the Space Inbetween You and the Steak, put the Thyme and Garlic</li>
            <li>Tilt the Skillet Towards you, so that the Butter Pools around the Thyme and Garlic</li>
            <li>Take a Spoon and use it to Throw the Butter onto the Steak. This is a Technique known as Basting</li>
            <li>Every 1 Minute, Flip the Steak Until it Reaches the Desired Internal Temperature</li>
            <li>Once the Steak is Finished Cooking, Let the Steak Rest for 5 to 10 Minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>

        </ol>
